What is Determined IELTS? ü§î
Determined IELTS is a web-based learning application built to provide a focused and engaging preparation experience for the four core modules of the IELTS exam: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. It features a clean, modern user interface, smooth animations, and a responsive design to ensure a great experience on any device.

Modern UI/UX: A sleek and contemporary design with smooth animations using Framer Motion to create a dynamic and enjoyable user experience.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Reusable Components: Key UI elements like the Navbar, Footer, and module Cards are built as reusable components for consistency and easy maintenance.

Seamless Navigation: A unique, responsive Navbar that changes its style on scroll for a polished feel.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
